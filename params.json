{"name":"Freehand-circles-drawing-tool","tagline":"A userscript that lets you draw directly onto images on any Stack Exchange site to add freehand circles (or anything else you might like to add)!","body":"### Welcome to the Stack Exchange Freehand Circles Drawing tool.\r\nThis userscript makes it *extremely* easy to draw circles (or anything else) onto images directly on the Stack Exchange sites! It's very easy to use and saves any changes for you itself.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n1. Go to any post on any site\r\n2. Click the new `Edit` button that has been added\r\n3. Draw as much as you want\r\n4. Click save - the new image will be created and saved automatically\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. You need an access token. Get one [here]()\r\n2. Install [Greasemonkey]() (Firefox) or [Tampermonkey]() (Chrome). These are userscript managers and allow the script to make use of `GM_*` functions, which it relies on to save your access token\r\n3. Install the script: <kbd>[Install]()</kbd> or <kbd>[View Source]()</kbd>\r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n1. Images are save on imgur.com and NOT stack.imgur.com (Stack Exchange's own account for inline images). This shouldn't be a problem because it [says here](https://help.imgur.com/hc/en-us/articles/201476457-How-long-do-you-keep-the-images-) that images are kept forever...\r\n2. The script works thanks to [Fabric.JS](http://fabricjs.com/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)\r\n3. This script has only been tested on Google Chrome Windows 7 64 bit - I haven't tested on other browsers/OSes, but it should work!\r\n\r\n### Bugs/Feature Requests\r\nPlease post bugs and feature requests at the repo OR at [StackApps](http://stackapps.com/q/6353/26088) :) I'll try my best to fix/add anything!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
